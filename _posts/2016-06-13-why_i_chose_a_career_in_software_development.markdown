My wife's career ended up taking us to Norway. Having no professional contacts in Norway and zero Norwegian knowledge meant that I was going to have to start over again, so I decided to do what I was most interested in.

I have always been a technology enthusiast and tinkerer. Growing up I built the kind of primitive websites showcasing my favorite bands and interests that were the precursor to apps like myspace and facebook. My master's thesis was on the intersection between the internet and literature, detailing how technology was enabling new voices a platform and at the same time shaping the a genre of literature, flash fiction, that is easily consumable on platforms like cellphones and tablets. So I have always been around the edges of technology.

After doing coding tutorials and learning the foundations of modern web development at Treehouse, I knew that building modern web applications was for me. Web development is an exciting, ever-changing field that is shaping the world in which we live. It is really awesome to build stuff that is useful to other people. For example, I just built my first [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/nytimes_cli), which allows users to read the New York Times from the command line. Seeing the amount of downloads go up is nearly as rewarding as the rush you get from completing the first working version.

If I had to sum my reasons for choosing software development in as few words as possible:

Software is the future and I want to be a part of building the future.
